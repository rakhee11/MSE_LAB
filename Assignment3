Q1> Explore the DVM instructions and prepare a summary of the same atleast for 5 instructions in a detailed format
i) instruction name:
ii) syntax
iii)example


ANS:
Dalvik Instruction Set:

1>
Instruction:
move vA, vB
Arguements:
A: destination register (4 bits)
B: source register (4 bits)
Description:
Move the contents of one non-object register to another.
--------------------------------------------------------
2>
Instruction:
move-wide/from16 vAA, vBBBB
Arguements:
A: destination register pair (8 bits)
B: source register pair (16 bits)
Description:
Move the contents of one register-pair to another.
--------------------------------------------------------
3>
Instruction:
return vAA
Arguements:
A: return value register (8 bits)
Description:
Return from a single-width (32-bit) non-object value-returning method
--------------------------------------------------------
4>
Instruction:
const/4 vA, #+B
Arguements:
A: destination register (4 bits)
B: signed int (4 bits)
Description:
Move the given literal value (sign-extended to 32 bits) into the specified register.
--------------------------------------------------------
5>
Instruction:
monitor-enter vAA
Arguements:
A: reference-bearing register (8 bits)
Description:
Acquire the monitor for the indicated object.


Q2> Differentiate between mobile and cloud computing.
ANS:
Cloud Computing:
1>allows you to store your files and folders in a “cloud” area on the Internet,
allowing you access to all of your files and folders wherever you are in the 
world but you do need a physical device with Internet access to access it.
2>lack of control over personal data.Insufficient information regarding how,
where and by whom data is being processed.
3) The application would function as a communicator with the cloud server which function
would be to display the data received by it.
4) The increased use of cloud computing could lead to a reduction in demand for high storage capacity consumer end devices, due to cheaper low storage devices that stream all content via the cloud becoming more popular.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mobile computing:
1>It is taking a physical device with you. This could be a laptop or a mobile phone 
or some device which enables you to telework – working wherever you go because of
the small size of the device you’re using.
2) Allows us to store files on ‘physical devices’ like laptop or mobile phones.
3) The application might interact with servers on the Internet to get
information  the application needed.
4) Screens and keyboards tend to be small, which may make them hard to use. Alternate input methods such as speech or handwriting recognition require training.
5>communications no longer run over a private network.

Q3> Give an example of an application simulating an environment of  context aware computing and justify.

Context In general the term “Context” refers to the general situation of the person, device
or application.
Over the years this general definition has been broadened and clarified.
Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation
of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered
relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including
the user and applications themselves.
Context-aware computing : “Context-aware computing” has been established as the practice of incorporating
contextual information into services to allow them to react and adapt to their
environment .
         
 EXAMPLE:
 Application in health care
explanation:
Modern integrated voice and data communications equips the hospital staff with smart phones to communicate 
vocally with each other, but preferably to look up the next task to be executed and to capture the next report 
to be noted.However, all attempts to support staff with such approaches are hampered till failure of acceptance 
with the need to look up upon a new event for patient identities, order lists and work schedules. Hence a well 
suited solution has to get rid of such manual interaction with a tiny screen and therefore serves the user with
-automated identifying actual patient and local environment upon approach,
-automated recording the events with coming to and leaving off the actual patient,
-automated presentation of the orders or service due on the current location and with supported documenting 
the required information keying in a minimum of data into prepared form entries.
